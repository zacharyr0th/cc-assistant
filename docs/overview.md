# Claude Code Overview

## What It Is
Claude Code is Anthropic's terminal-based agentic coding tool designed to accelerate development. As described in the documentation, it helps developers "turn ideas into code faster than ever before."

## Installation Options
The tool supports multiple installation methods:
- Shell script (macOS/Linux)
- Homebrew package manager
- PowerShell (Windows)
- NPM (requires Node.js 18+)

Basic usage involves navigating to a project directory and running the `claude` command.

## Core Capabilities
Claude Code offers four main functions:
1. **Feature development** - Converting English descriptions into functional code with planning and validation
2. **Debugging** - Analyzing errors and implementing solutions across codebases
3. **Code exploration** - Answering questions about project structure with web integration and external data source access via MCP
4. **Task automation** - Handling repetitive development work like linting and conflict resolution

## Key Strengths
The platform distinguishes itself through:
- **Terminal integration** rather than separate interfaces
- **Direct action capabilities** including file editing and git commits
- **Unix composability** supporting piping and scripting
- **Enterprise features** including security, privacy, and compliance infrastructure

## Getting Started
New users can install Claude Code and begin work in under 30 minutes. A VS Code extension is available for those preferring graphical interfaces, and comprehensive documentation covers quickstarts, workflows, and troubleshooting.
