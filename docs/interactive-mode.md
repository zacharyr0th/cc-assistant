# Claude Code Interactive Mode Documentation Summary

This documentation provides a comprehensive reference for using Claude Code's interactive features through keyboard shortcuts, input modes, and session controls.

## Key Keyboard Controls

The core interactive shortcuts include general controls like `Ctrl+C` to "Cancel current input or generation" and `Ctrl+D` for exiting sessions. Navigation uses arrow keys, while `Ctrl+L` clears the screen while preserving conversation history. Advanced features include `Ctrl+V` (or `Alt+V` on Windows) to "Paste image from clipboard" and `Esc+Esc` to "Rewind the code/conversation."

## Extended Thinking and Permissions

Users can toggle extended thinking functionality using the `Tab` key, switching between enabled and disabled states. Permission modes—accessible via `Shift+Tab` or `Alt+M`—allow toggling among Auto-Accept Mode, Plan Mode, and standard mode.

## Input Methods

For multiline input, the documentation lists multiple approaches: backslash-enter works universally, `Option+Enter` defaults on macOS, and `Shift+Enter` functions after running `/terminal-setup`. Users can paste code blocks directly or use `Ctrl+J` as an alternative.

## Quick Command Prefixes

The interface supports quick commands: `#` adds entries to CLAUDE.md, `/` activates slash commands, `!` enables bash mode for direct command execution, and `@` triggers file path autocomplete.

## Vim Mode and Advanced Features

Vim-style editing is available through `/vim`, with standard modal navigation and editing commands. The system maintains per-directory command history, supports reverse searching via `Ctrl+R`, and allows backgrounding long processes with `Ctrl+B`.
