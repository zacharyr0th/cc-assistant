# Claude Code: Legal and Compliance Documentation

## Overview
This page outlines the legal framework, compliance standards, and security protocols governing Claude Code usage.

## Key Legal Requirements

**Licensing Structure**: Usage terms depend on account type. The documentation states: "Your use of Claude Code is subject to" either Commercial Terms (for Team, Enterprise, and API users) or Consumer Terms (for Free, Pro, and Max accounts).

**Commercial Agreements**: Existing agreements automatically apply to Claude Code, whether customers use the API directly or through AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex platforms, unless parties have negotiated different terms.

## Compliance Provisions

**Healthcare Compliance**: Organizations with a Business Associate Agreement and Zero Data Retention enabled will have automatic BAA coverage extended to Claude Code usage on their API traffic.

## Trust and Security Resources

The company maintains transparency through dedicated resources, including their Trust Center and Transparency Hub for security and safety information.

**Vulnerability Reporting**: Security researchers can report vulnerabilities through Anthropic's HackerOne program using their designated reporting form.
